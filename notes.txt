2. https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-common-subsequence
3. most efficient solved for finding the LCS is with a matrix because it breaks down the problam to smaller problams and it
allowes for backtrucks of the LCS.

fix:
when going down a line in the mid of a row it deletes the content before
new line without content (does not work)
delete half works.(maybe change so when i prees on delete it will check if the line is emty )
other client can't see the output of the other client
other client can edit the file

do:

check if it works with pasting code.
add syntexs highlites.
what is async???
maybe create websockets, on the python side and use ready lib in js. (probbly will not)

done:
change to use actions insted of sending all the countent like delete (number row),change (this row), add a row and more.
