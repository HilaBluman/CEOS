create:
when not in the tab of the page disconnect or wait till theuser is back then get updates. pade hide does not do that!!
fix file name pos
what is async??? (read about it)
other client can see the output of the other client
other client can edit the file

how can we know how can edit the file?
need to view all the files the user can edit in files
when preesing on the file names need to swich to teh file.

points for later:
* when creating a new file:
    create a unique file id
    enter permisions for the users that can edit

LCS - Longest Common Subsequence:
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/
2. https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-common-subsequence
3. most efficient solved for finding the LCS is with a matrix because it breaks down the problam to smaller problams and it
allowes for backtrucks of the LCS.
