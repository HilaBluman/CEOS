create:
* what is async??? (read about it)
* allow the creater of the file to allow users to access file
* add the user name next to the curser of the person that is editing the file (maybe use different colors foe each person) - see whatsupp
* add an option to see the changes that happend from the a spacific time and date (using the changes to go back? than use LSC to show the changes) - see whatsupp
* maybe add verstions - see whatsupp (save every 20 modiftions or 1 day if less modiftions) (if no modftions for a long time it wont save an till there i modiftion)



applyUpdate bugs:
✔️ deleting a line (not highlight) - an empty line 
✔️ hendle delete 
⚪️ hendle pasting -(have a problam with saving paste) when pasting more then 1 line it replaces the lines below (one line good)
✔️ hendle a new row
⚪️ new row in a mid of chacters - enters paste (problam in hendling - the other client & server is not getiing the right content)

⚪️ whats the point of lineLegth????
⚪️ fix resizing - so right panle will show all ways
⚪️ delete same line in row 1 it copys the row 1 to row 0 but does not remove row 0
Error modifying file: An error occurred: list index out of range
⚪️ have a problam with cmd/crl z
- fix paste func: there is a problam with the spaces for example ,if i paste normal there is a new between the first line and the rest. solve(send all the lines in the mid as one insert.)
⚪️ the icon is not loading




done:
✔️ creating a new file
✔️ sends the same content from data base to more than 1 time - check lock on db && lock file when writing in to it
✔️ the code editor does not show the options of completion to the word - the problam was in the css because i used (margin-top: 50px) it affected the options in the tab of completion options. i fixed it by moving the (margin-top: 50px) to the tab css 
✔️ the list of the files the user can acces on the side
✔️ when pressing on the file names need to switch to the file.
✔️ name of the file at the top
✔️ other client can see the output of the other client
✔️ other client can edit the file
✔️ change to use actions instead of sending all the content like delete (number row),change (this row), add a row and more.
✔️ add syntax highlight - monoco editor
✔️ handle disconnection
✔️ change the urls in the js files from http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to the real one.
✔️ does not send the whole js or html file - was a problem in the ready to send func
✔️ save is lag and slow  ???(could be because of the reconnection problem ) - disconnect after each request
✔️ when useing it keeps on reconnection (does not really disconnect) - disconnects after each request
✔️ it gets stuck after few inputs!!! - disconnects after each request
✔️ when pasting only pastes the line the curser was on 
✔️ inserts at the start after load, need to fix
✔️ functions that does not work: onDocumentDelete. (listener on document instead of code-editor)
✔️ does not work when deleting multiple lines (changed so when i press on delete it will check of highlighted if so updates the first line then deletes the rest)
✔️ when adding a new line in the mid of a file the data after deletes. ( added "\r")
✔️ when updating a line the rest of the data after said line.
✔️ when it disconnect i get these errors in the console log 1. Failed to load resource: net:ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH  2. Error saving file: TypeError: Failed to fetch saveInput. it happens when Timeout while receiving headers - gets onr byte at a time.
✔️save is lag and slow
