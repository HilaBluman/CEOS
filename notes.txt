create:
when not in the tab of the page disconnect or wait till the user is back then get updates. Page hide does not do that!!
fix file name pos
what is async??? (read about it)
other client can see the output of the other client
other client can edit the file

how can we know how can edit the file?
need to view all the files the user can edit in files
when pressing on the file names need to switch to the file.

points for later:
* when creating a new file:
    create a unique file id
    enter permissions for the users that can edit


bugs:
// change the urls in the js files from http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to the real one.
⚪️ handle disconnection
⚪️ the code editor does not show the options of completion to the word
⚪️ fix paste func (have a problem with a lot of lines - maybe lock is the solution?)

✔️ does not send the whole js or html file - was a problem in the ready to send func
✔️ save is lag and slow  ???(could be because of the reconnection problem ) - disconnect after each request
✔️ when useing it keeps on reconnection (does not really disconnect) - disconnects after each request
✔️ it gets stuck after few inputs!!! - disconnects after each request
✔️ when pasting only pastes the line the curser was on 
✔️ inserts at the start after load, need to fix
✔️ functions that does not work: onDocumentDelete. (listener on document instead of code-editor)
✔️ does not work when deleting multiple lines (changed so when i press on delete it will check of highlighted if so updates the first line then deletes the rest)
✔️ when adding a new line in the mid of a file the data after deletes. ( added "\r")
✔️ when updating a line the rest of the data after said line.
✔️ when it disconnect i get these errors in the console log 1. Failed to load resource: net:ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH  2. Error saving file: TypeError: Failed to fetch saveInput. it happens when Timeout while receiving headers - gets onr byte at a time.
✔️save is lag and slow


done:
✔️ change to use actions instead of sending all the content like delete (number row),change (this row), add a row and more.
✔️ add syntax highlight - monoco editor

check on:
⚪️ need protection from code & SCL injctions.
